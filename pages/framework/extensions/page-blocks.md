Page blocks is a custom post type that will help you create custom page content for specific page areas. Please note that this post type __must utilize the theme page builder__ in order to create a page block.  Currently page blocks can be used in Creatus theme __Hero sections__ and __Footer__. This ability might be further extended in the future. Watch the video to understand how this post type is to be used.
