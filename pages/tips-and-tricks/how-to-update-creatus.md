Creatus WordPress Theme is using WordPress update utility to notify you of updates. If you see the update simply select the Creatus theme from themes for update list and click on __Update Themes__ button. After the update theme might notify you if there are any __theme required plugins__ updates. Once you see the notice simply follow the link and update required plugins. If you have any issues with this procedure follow FTP update instructions.
